2FOS stands for "Free Open Source Food Ordering System". Our goal is, to support people who have to manage food orders in companies or schools for their colleagues with a simple and (hopefully in future) powerful food order collection system. This program provides your colleagues (users) with a webinterface in which they can place their individual orders. You (the admin) gets a simple list with all ordered dishes. In the admin-interface all orders are summed up, so its simple to place an cummulative order by mail or phone to the food-service of your choice.
